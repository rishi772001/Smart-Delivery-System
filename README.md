# Smart-Postal-System

With the increasing population, postmen find very difficult to deliver all posts in the correct locations. The delivery of posts is delayed mainly due to the repetition of already visited locations. The admin of postmen also takes lots of time to classify and assign posts to every postman.<br>

The proposed system is a application which eliminates all these problems and help in faster delivery of posts. This System displays the addresses of posts to be delivered in map and provide shortest path by which there is no repetition of already visited locations. Admin is facilitated by classification and automatic assignmens of posts to respective postman. It also provides people about the status of the posts by displaying number of pending posts.<br><br>
